Mini Incident Report
====================

Project: Log Analysis and Alerting Simulation
Date: 13 May 2025
Analyst: Deadbeat Saint

Objective:
----------
To simulate basic log analysis and alerting on a sample authentication log using a custom Python Script

Summary of Findings:
--------------------
- Total Failed Login Attempts: 5
- Top Suspicious IPs:
    - [192.168.1.10] - 2 attempts
    - [203.0.113.55] - 2 attempts
- Hour with highest activity: 2'pm

Recommendations:
- Block top offending IPs at the firewall level. 

Conclusion:
The script succesfully parsed logs and extracted key threat indicators llike brute-force attempts and peak alert times.
Further enhancements may include real-time monitoring and automated alerting.
